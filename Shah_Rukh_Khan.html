    <h2>Early Life and Family</h2>
    <div class="early-life">
        <div class="history">
            Shah Rukh Khan, apart from being one of the biggest stars in the country and the world, is also among
            the
            highest paid film stars. He may be living life king sized now with his family of five, houses around the
            world, zig wheels at his disposal and the latest gadgets, but this superstar is still a humble boy from
            Delhi at heart.

            Born and brought up in a middle-class family, with a father who ran small businesses including a
            canteen,
            this star has seen the highest highs and the lowest lows, all within just 52 years. His journey although
            winding, has taken him from the by-lanes of Delhi to the corridors of Oxford University and beyond which
            is
            nothing short of inspiring.
            <br>
            Any SRK fan would know of his tryst with destiny that started off on the sets of a TV series ‘Fauji’ in
            1989
            and continued with shows like ‘Circus’ and ‘Umeed’. However, it was only until ‘Deewana’ came along that
            he
            got his big film break and tasted success at the box office and also picked up a Filmfare Best Male
            Debut
            Award that year. He quickly moved up the ranks, from a supporting actor to a lead star and even taking
            on a
            bold decision to play the anti-hero, all within the initial stages of his career. His performance in
            ‘Daar’,
            was deemed as one of his best works till date and even earned him Filmfare Award for Best Performance in
            a
            Negative Role. However, it was ‘Baazigar’ that earned him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.
